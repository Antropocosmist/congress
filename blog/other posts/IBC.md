### IBC: a game-changer for the web

**Introduction**

Since the rise of blockchain, technology evolves for the sake of decentralization and humanity, rather than feeding megacorps and solitary beneficiaries. But even today, communication in technology, and especially in blockchain, is still an issue. The extent of problems for interoperable protocols has to take into account is astonishing: security, efficiency, horizontal scalability, etc.

Luckily for blockchain and technology, companies like Tendermint are solving this issue. With the birth of such protocols as IBC, sovereign blockchains will now be able to communicate and swap data.

Cyber aims to make knowledge interoperable. Provable, auditable and verifiable knowledge, that can make a foundation for an open and decentralized semantical field for the new Great Web, with a lot more to be yielded as a result.

**Why does cyber need IBC?**

Cyber can become an oracle of data for other chains. Cyber is a decentralized google for provable and relevant answers. It builds a decentralised knowledge graph, which due to the use of Merkle trees and economic incentives, can easily act as a predictive model for the universe.

As cyber is planning on indexing and crawling through a vast amount of data, it can easily become an influential computational source of power amongst users. A truly decentralized root of computation that can help to validate other chains that build knowledge graphs of their own. But, that is by far not it. Due to cybers nature of being able to dynamically rank objects, it can become a market for reputation, ranking and even being able to, calculating bandwidth of other chains via the powers of IBC.

**Why does IBC matter for search engines?**

The goal behind cyber as a protocol is not just to stay a source of verifiable knowledge. By forking cyb, a decentralized, personal browser application for web 3, people can create their own, specifically targeted knowledge graphs. Cyber is a general-purpose engine. Search needs to communicate among distributed databases.

Think google. It doesn't search through as many things on the Internet as you might think. In fact, many things like, certain social networks, academic work, etc, stay out of the scope of the big evil beast that google has become. A search engine powered by cyber and IBC can fix this. It can create intercommunication between knowledge graphs.

An interknowledge protocol, powered by IBC, can function in several ways. A) It can subscribe and transfer ranks between chains. B) It can subscribe and transfer forth and back content identificators. C) It can transfer proof of relevance between any two objects for any 2 blockchains (i.e. act as a relevance machine). D) It can help to determine the value of such assets as data.

In addition to this, a search engine like cyber uses a resource credit model for searching, which is in essence bandwidth instead of transactional cost. This makes search immune to spam and with the help of IBC other search engines can adapt this model.

**How will IBC be used at cyber hub level?**

Firstly an inter-knowledge protocol, that functions as a communication artery over IBC. The main exchange of knowledge for the new, Great Web, between any chains connected to the cyber hub via IBC. And, of course, any other hubs connected to cyber via IBC.

Different specific knowledge search engines might have different purposes and different goals. They might (and probably will) have own governance, own tokens and own needs. IBC in cyber will be able to provide just that - establish cross-communication between those zones.

With the help of IBC, zones within cyber will be able to take advantage of forming a bigger picture and partnering to support one another. This will also help to reduce the burden of indexing knowledge that already exists within the hub itself.

Cyber hub will function as a major artery of the market, becoming a trade hub for domain-specific knowledge graphs. Onchain market makers may provide additional liquidity to projects who choose to fork and use cyberd as a module on their blockchain.

**Interchain governance**

Of course, just as chains inside the hub may take advantage of IBC, chains outside will benefit too. IBC will bring the ability to cross governance for blockchains. And, theoretically, cross security in chains. This will create competitive markets for validation. Via the use of IBC cyber will be able to bring its share of this to the market.

**Interchain of markets and thinking beyond existing borders**

We already mentioned rank markets and knowledge markets. But what about the real endless possibilities that IBC gives any chain in terms of data transfer?

Data transfer can, and will, create a massive organic, never-ending, marketplace for web 3. Where one chain can trade rank with cyber for X and another for Y.

Semantics makes the world spin round. It is used in political decisions, in logistics, in mapping, in financial decisions, social decisions, used to gain knowledge, etc. It can easily become an important trading asset.

If we look at the broader picture, then your digital print (or your soul) has been wondering the digital realm for years and with blockchain and cryptography on the scene, your digital soul has gained digital money, digital freedom in decision making (consensus rules) and a digital fingerprint (your private key). People need to understand that the further we move, the more important it becomes to make sure we are in control of our information.

cyber and cyberlinks provide those super-powers, IBC helps cyber to spread this asset amongst humanity and well beyond it. Creating cross-communication between knowledge graphs, that aren't just charged by humans, but with the help of ML, knowledge graphs that are charged by anything with an electromagnetic impulse.

Such a simple mechanism that cyber provides, changes the game. It changes the existing semantic field and gives the power of decision making back into the hands of the people. Along the way, creating a place for things like autonomous robots, personal data and knowledge bases, prediction markets, oracles and even predictive modelling of emotional mechanisms with the help of second layer semantics.

With the help of IBC, cyber can help other chains, focused on specific ideas with proofs and with value. For example, a location-based search (for chains like FOAM) can also become provable, if web3-agents will mine triangulations and attach ‘proof of location’ for every linked chain.

Cyber is a decentralized google, but wouldn't it be fair if anyone could own a piece of google. IBC gives cyber those abilities. To help spread one of the most important assets that humanity created amongst any kind of thinking species.
