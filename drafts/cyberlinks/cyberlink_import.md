# How to import cyberlinks from `euler-5` to `euler-6`
This guide will explain several ways to migrate your cyberlinks. 

According to [our migration proposal](https://cybercongress.ai/euler-6-migration/), the [IPLD structure](https://io.cybernode.ai/api/v0/dag/get?arg=bafyreibnn7bfilbmkrxm2rwk5fe6qzzdvm2xen34cjdktdoex4uylb76z4/) with the links made by masters has been prepared and is ready to be moved across testnets. These are the tools for masters to migrate their links from `euler-5` to `euler-6` network, depending on how you created your links:

## All of my cyberlinks were done using a Ledger 
Nice! Connect your Ledger device to the [cyber.page app and pocket it](https://cyber.page/pocket) by clicking to the robot icon in the top right corner and pushing the `put ledger` button. If you don't see the button, your cookies have been saved and you should just skip the first step.

1. Your Ledger should be connected to the computer and the cosmos app should be open:

2. After a successful connection, you should see your `cyber` and `cosmos` addresses and the box with the proposal to import the cyberlinks using your Ledger (if you don't see this box, but you are sure that you have used your Ledger to cyberlink, click on the top box with the addresses and a `Drop key` button in the bottom will appear. Click it and reload the page):

3. Ledgers memory capability only allows signing 7 messages at a time. This means that you need to make several transactions to import all your links if they amount to more than 7:

4. Click on the first cyberlink and push the `sign` button to generate the transaction:

4. Confirm the transaction data on your Ledger device, press `Fuck Google` on the screen, rinse and repeat until done. 

## All my cyberlinks were done using the CLI
1.In this case, import your `cyber` address manually by clicking the `put read-only address` button:

2. You should see a box that says: `You created N cyberlinks in euler-5. Import cli`:

3. Click on the section. The `tx_links.json` file should start to download automatically. If not, try reloading the page. 

4. Open the console and sign the transaction file with your account (obviosuly your Ledger should be connected with the Cosmos app opened):

```bash
cyberdcli tx sign <PATH_TO_TX_LINK>/tx_links.json --from <account_name> --output-document <PATH_TO_TX_LINK>/tx_links_signed.json --chain-id euler-6
```

5. The output document is a signed transaction ready for broadcasting. Let's send it to the network:

```bash
cyberdcli tx broadcast  <PATH_TO_TX_LINK>/tx_links_signed.json --chain-id euler-6
```

6. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, you will see your `euler-5` links in the `euler-6` network.

## All of my cyberlinks were done using cyb~Virus
1. Open the cyb~Virus extension and export your private key

2. You need to import your private key into cyber, using the CLI. Open the console and import the key:

```bash
 cyberdcli keys add private <your_key_name>
 ```
 
 <your_key_name> is just any random nickname you choose. The system will ask you to enter a passphrase, you should do this too. 
 
 3. Next type in the following command:
 
 ```bash
 cyberdcli keys list
 ```
 
 This will return your cyber address (under the name you picked earlier). Copy the `cyber` address
 
 4. Now go to the ` All my cyberlinks were done using the CLI` of this document and do steps 1 - 6.
