# cyber~Congress: The evolution of species

`The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.` <br> `Carl Sagan`

## The Idea
Blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development which was previously impossible. 

The great John Lenon once said: <br>
`Imagine there's no countries` <br>
`Nothing to kill or die for` <br>
`And no religion, too` <br>
`You may say I'm a dreamer` <br> 
`I hope someday you'll join us` <br>
`And the world will be as one` <br>

Those words are not kept to their original order, but they still carry the same message that we share. 

One of the most difficult tasks is to make an agreement, which doesn't resemble an agreement... Here, we define `cyber~Congress` - a sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen that create the foundation for a new kind of existence.

## Our Mission
To help the evolution of species!

Over 40 years ago, Earth launched Voyager 1 and 2 into deep space. Until today, this mission [is ongoing](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/) and keeps uniting us as species and gives all of us hope. With the Voyagers, our species sent the [`golden record`](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/whats-on-the-record/) to space, assembled out of 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind and thunder, birds, whales, and other animals. To this, they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, and spoken greetings from Earth-people in fifty-five languages. 

That record carries what we believe in, with this, below, we have outlined the goals and values that we believe in the most. This is a hard mission, as our foremost wish is freedom and outlining anything when speaking of freedom is hard. 

## Our Goals
- Build a strong scientific foundation behind cybernomics
- Provide abundant access to information proved by transactions for all species
- Build an incentivization system for open-source communities and creators
- Make consensus computers more usable, scalable, performant and cheaper
- Develop hardware interfaces and software protocols for ubiquitous, private and uncensored communications across universes
- Integrate post-quantum cryptography
- Develop open-source technologies for self-sustainable living
- Find an open approach for creating self-aware, self-replicating and economically independent robots
- Create open-source, mainstream tools for biological engineering and body augmentations
- Integrate cybernomics into humans, robots, animals, plants and other thinking formations
- Demolish all state borders across the universe
- Find an open approach for creating incentivized and decentralized AI
- Switch governmentally inclined business models from violent taxing to non-violent modelling
- Find a replacement for existing formations that have the monopoly on taxing and control over species
- Abolish the existing chains of inbuilt fear that is controlled via centralised communication protocols
- Change the course of anthropology and sociology back to its natural ways via free will and decentralization
- Create technologies for accessible space exploration and transportation
- Create technologies for the transfer of human consciousness to an electronic and digital environment
- Significantly extend living capabilities for all species up to, but not limited to, 10k years
- Create the foundation for thermoregulation, terraforming the Earth and other nearby planets
- Build the foundation for the emergence of a unified spacetime ownership registry
- Participate in the development of Metaverse

## Our Values
We believe that our principles should be aligned with our values, helping us to achieve our goals:
- Security. We do not work with fiat or with bureaucratic paper hassle. We work with digital signatures only
- Anonymity and privacy. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private - it is their right to do so
- Open-source software. Everything we run in production must be open-source
- Open-source hardware. Every piece of hardware that goes into production, must be open-sourced
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of any information
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Capital, not salary. Helping to switch from, dragging to the bottom salary - to a capital-based passive income for all
- Engineering is marketing. We would rather spend our resources on engineering than on marketing
- Physical liberty. Limitations for physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation. Everything that can be automated, must be automated
- Intelligence. An entity can be treated as intelligent if they can control their private keys and sign transactions
- Decentralization. Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge. We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

Below is one of the most important quotes ever said on Earth by Carl Sagan:

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”
― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

We share this vision, but we look forward and even beyond it. 

We understand that technicalities are boring, but we want to be transparent. Below you can find technical details about the congress and our stack:

## Governance
cyber~Congress is founded by the following cryptographic entities using the [genesis account](0x9f4062F6153Ff4Dbf93F6A6F686eD3C906Bf0684):
- @21xhipster: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/21xhipster), [Ethereum ID](0xfbb2a29dff113d518893c00387f6d5492898354e)
- @litvintech: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/litvintech), [Ethereum ID](0x00B8Fe1A1A2b899418702e32A96E276Ff56A4D05)
- @hleb-albau: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/hleb_albau), [Ethereum ID](0x00725D89a2A2FB3B21Fd1035B579cbCDE4a0991b)

The foundation timestamp, is a timestamp of the last transaction from every signature account to a multisig account that contains an IPFS hash of this document as a payload + the hash of the last git commit.

The following accounts of cyber~Congress are official:
- Ethereum 2of3: [0xB52B7EdA722249499e3a28B5BB6c778ee0Ac462c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB52B7EdA722249499e3a28B5BB6c778ee0Ac462c)
- Bitcoin 2of3: [38W5xwiJTYAL5aLcokdYNvY28DAzS6Piqz](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/38W5xwiJTYAL5aLcokdYNvY28DAzS6Piqz)

All decisions must be proved by a transaction from one of the congress accounts. The signature accounts which control the multisig accounts are also considered official. For the time being, all other accounts must be registered in this document.

We are starting from the simplest but a resilient form of decentralization: a simple 2of3 multisig. We value decentralization and agree that we will do our best to throw more brains into the pot. More brains can support more income. We also understand, that decentralization always comes at expenses. For now, we struggle to find an organic growth balance between those kinds of expenses and an income. We understand that a flat voting system does not scale to more than 7 members. Thus, if there will be demand for further growth, we will make a decision based on in-depth research in the field.

Members communicate between themselves and between teams by using provably secure communication channels. At the moment, we use Keybase for communication. If any teams wish to use a more convenient channel, they are welcome to do so.

cyber~Congress can hire. Our goal is `number of employees = number of members * X`, the `X` is `7`.

cyber~Congress forms communities around our ideas through investing into different tokens. All drops to the members of the community are computed proportionally to the valuation of assets under control.

## Adding members
Currently, cyber•Congress can be expanded only to an odd number of members.

If someone wants to become a member - they can. If one member wants to quit the congress - they can. Congress can decide to drop out a member. In any case, they need to create a proposal [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/labels/Type%3A%20Proposal). Congress can fill the proposal here: [proposals](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/labels/Type%3A%20Proposal).

## Removing members
If one member is leaving, they receive a one-time drop, which is calculated by using the following formula:
`total valuation of assets under control/number of member * 50%`

The other 50% will be split evenly between teams and between the community.
The drop must be executed in 30 calendar days after the initiation of a proposal.

## Liquidation procedure
Congress can liquidate itself. If this event happens the following will occur:
- The software goes to a public domain
- The hardware obtains personal freedom
- Non-transferable tokens will await being transferable
- Non-fungible items will be auctioned
- 50% of transferable tokens, will be dropped to community members. 25% will be dropped to teams. The remaining 25% will be given to the   community, either in the form of a drop or a burn

## Processing incoming drops
If a community decides to drop to cyber•Congress, they must understand the following guidelines:
- 60% is dumped back in favour of our communities and will remain under the control of cyber~Congress. cyber~Congress can choose to fully keep the dropped tokens to itself
- 20% of the tokens will be dropped to community members
- 20% of the tokens will be dropped to teams

## Forks
If any team feel the independent need to create a new organization or a fork, they are free to do so. Congress members will benefit from such behaviour and are ready, in case the team is self-sustainable, to transfer repositories.
