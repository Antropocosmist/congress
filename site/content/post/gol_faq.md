## Linking:
**Q: Which types/themes of a content are the most important to link at first?**
A: This story about a decentralized search engine. Link the content important for you first.

**Q: How does an algorithm decide of relevancy of the content?**
A: Briefly, the rank of CID (content) depends on the number of links to/from that CID, and on Agents balance, linked it.

**Q:Any info about the relevance/ranking system of the content that might be helpful. Or does it have to be ‚Äúblackbox‚Äù for the game to prevent abuse? There is some info in the Whitepaper, but what if we try to make it more simple for the average user.**
A: There are no blackboxes in that algorithm. Anyone with the necessary skills can implement it and validate it. The simplest definition of cyber~Rank is "as many tokens you have as higher your linked CID in search results".

**Q: How to choose ‚Äúkey words‚Äù?**
A: As you chose keywords to search content in Google üòÉ There is not subject to cover all keywords because the community will add all necessary in the future as a self-organized system. But if you want to try, you can use some parsing tools for export keywords from the text, for example, and will link the content with each of them.

**Q: How many ‚Äúkey words‚Äù is optimal for the link on average?**
A: From one to infinity üòÉ. This is an iteration way, you can link the content again and again with new keywords in all time and make the search better.

**Q: How do the ‚Äúkey words‚Äù effect relevance of the content?**
A: There is no. The relevance machine does not understand anything about keywords and content. Moreover, it's not seen the difference between keywords and content. Keywords affect only users' experience: if they can find all they want - it's cool, in other cases - it's sucks.

**Q:In the cyb-browser-extension it says"Keywords: (separate by comma)". Does it mean that we don‚Äôt need spaces between the comma and next ‚Äúkey word‚Äù? For example (keyword1,keyword2,keyword3) or (keyword1, keyword2, keyword3). Which one is correct?**
A: The cyb-virus extension is work in progress state now. We're want to design it pretty useful.

**Q: How to link the content if it contains two or more pages/files? If the user used IPFS before he can find a way, but if the user do this with google chrome extension. How to make this easier?**
A: The cyb-virus extension is work in progress state now. We're want to design it pretty useful.

**Q: Basic guide/tutorial how to handle with IPFS for the first time.There is full documentation to IPFS but that can be too complex for the non-technical users. May be we can make even more simple guides/tutorials to simplify the process for an average Joe.**
A: You can start [with it](https://flyingzumwalt.gitbooks.io/decentralized-web-primer/)

**Q: May be we can use simple services like pinata for storing the content. To be sure that CID(content) is available.**
AA: As a community of decentralized world dreamers we're not welcome any centralized solutions for your own data. Especially with KYC. Your content outside your control is not your content :)

**Q: Is there the place where we can see all the CIDs(links to the content) that we put from the same account with simple UI?**
A: We've working on it already. It should be awesome.

**Q: Is there any kind of ladder or scoring system or anything like that? Any reasonable gamification is good for the KPI of the processes.**
A: Sure. Work in progress. It will in [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/) app.

**Q: Where can we see how many links we can add during 24 hours considering the current number of tokens in the account? In other words, to measure bandwidth in real time.**
A: Nice feature. Will add it to the backlog.

**Q: Assuming we using the simplest toolkit for linkng(cyb-browser-extension). What kind of most common tech errors can occur during the process?**
A: The cyb-virus extension is work in progress state now. We're want to design it pretty useful.

## Validation:

**Q: How to run a validator‚Äôs node quick and without pain?**
A: We have tutorial video. (right?)

## Creation cool things as a Developer

**Q: Why is it so important in the first place?** 
A: Religion comes first.

**Q: What kind of cool things are the most important to develop first? Is there any kind of list of it?**
A: Check the github issues first :) Also, the community always generate different ideas with different level of coolness :)

**Q: Basic tutorials to start.**
A: Try to [setup dev](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/0.1.5/docs/setup_dev_env.md) env first :) if the story about cyberd improvements. And feel free to communicate with the team :)

## Community pool & Marketing

**Q: How will it be measured?**
A: This reward will be distributed by the community decision. You need to prepare a nice feasibility study on your project and submit a proposal. How you measure it, what it's costs - you decide. But remember, the community decide to pass or reject your proposal :)

**Q: Marketing KPIs for fairer distribution of the pool. Or we can make some sort of a DAO in the future to make proposals for that kind of activity.**
A:

**Q: Which types of content are the most interesting for the project?**
A: Decentralized philosophy, guides, researches in text, video, music, whatever types. Your personal discovery of interesting use cases, hacking, and more and more. It can be even your diaries. Don't forget to link it :)

**Q: Will the connection with professional content producers or media with big enough and relevant audience be rewarded?**
A:
