> A bruise is a lesson... and each lesson makes us better. George R.R. Martin

The 27th of April, earlier this year, marked [the takeoff donation round](https://cyber.page/governance/2) for Cyber, and just as we mentioned earlier, `After a wild journey, the rocket is...still ready for launch`. However, launching means it has to fly. It takes courage to admit it, but it didn't. This means that we did something wrong and we have to try again. After all, Rome was not built in a day.

### Relaucnhing 
The reasoning for the relaunch has already been outlined by @hipster in the [new launch proposal](https://cyber.page/governance/5). We proposed to remove the lower boundary of the offering, lower the cap and increase the amount of time needed to attract the value desired.

The proposal has passed. This means it's time to fix the mistakes and to relaunch. And we are ready.

### Changes
As mentioned above, we think that lowering our valuation during these uncertain times, will work very well.  We believe that this and giving the participants of the takeoff round an amount of the supply that is not dependent on the outcome of the donation will evaluate the project more correctly without any risks for the donors. 

Long story short:

- Increase the amount of the duration of the takeoff donation round from 90 days to 146 days
- Lower the amount of the takeoff donation cap from 600k ATOM to 300k ATOM (those already donated, will get twice as much for the same money)
- CYB distribution of the takeoff round will happen proportionally per the donated ATOM + according to the order of donations
- This means that the discount is not dependent on the amount of ATOM donated
- The earlier you will donate, the bigger your discount will be
- The countdown will restart from 0 when the new takeoff will launch
- CYB allocation to cyber\~Congress, seed donors and inventors is not depending on the outcome of the funding anymore. The groups get 6, 4 and 2 percent of the allocation accordingly
- 3% of CYB is allocated to the development fund: cyber\~Fundclassic
- CYB tokens left after the takeoff, go to the community pool
- The disciplines of [GoL](https://cybercongress.ai/game-of-links/) still follow the same rules as those described in this article
- This means that the more ATOM is donated, the more CYB will be allocated to each, dependent on the takeoff round, discipline
- Any `change` of CYB from the disciplines which doesn't come into play will go back to cyber\~Congress
- Game of Thrones is dropped and cyber\~Auction is prolonged to 888 equal rounds of 24 hours each
- The [WP](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ1Vong13MDNxixDyUdjniqqEj8sjuNEBYMyhQU4gQgq3) has been updated accordingly 

### The new takeoff
Including all of the above information, here is our plan for the new takeoff:

- Prepare the adjustments for the docs: done
- Deliver a new takeoff proposal, this time within the Cosmos community, offering an amount of CYB for an amount of ATOM per takeoff price
- Push the evangelism program forward to more people that are interested in helping us with the takeoff round and beyond
- Carry on with the other plans to close off the new cap of 300,000 ATOM (angels, crypto communities, other sources of donations)
