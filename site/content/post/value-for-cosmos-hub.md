title: 'What will Cosmos Hub gain from participating in Cybers takeoff round?'

Upon discussing [proposal 26](https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/proposals/26) submitted by Cyber to the Cosmos hub, calling for it to make a collective decision about participating in its takeoff round, we came upon some fantastic feedback and excellent questions from atom holders. I would like to address 1 particular question and to clarify things a bit.

The most common question is what will Cosmos hub gain from having CYB tokens in its community pool. This is probably the most important question and I'm glad it was asked by so many people. This shows that people care about the ecosystem they are part of!

Before answering this question, let's look at what are CYB tokens and what is their primary use. To make a long story short, here are the 3 use-cases that CYB tokens have:

- Staking (securing the network and receiving rewards)
- Bandwidth limiting for submitting links. Transactions in Cyber don't have fees. This means that we need a spam protection mechanism. This role is carried out by our [energy model](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#general-questions). So instead of paying for every tx you spend some energy which is automatically recharged with time.
- Expression of intentions for ranking the content by the users. Cyber mission is to create an open semantic core that belongs to the users and crated by them. Hence, every time a user submits a cyberlink, he expresses his will, which is computed by validators. In other words, the validators index and rank the content based on the intentions of the users.

In Cyber almost every transaction has meaning and influences the current shape of the semantic core. This means that the computations in Cyber are useful and meaningful for the solving of this particular issue: the decentralization of the semantic core of The Great Web. CYB tokens and the energy model are the core utility of that mechanism.

## Successful case for DeVC

This proposal challenges the very essence of decentralization. What we propose is to experiment with DeVC o decentralized VC. Rather than going to VC, we want to utilise the instruments that Tendermint, Cosmos and decentralisation provide for us. Cyber coming to the Cosmos community pool is the same as going to a VC. Only here, we ask for a collective decision from the community to become our anchor funder. Think ICPO, initial community pool offering. We are sure that this will become a trend.

Cyber project is a perfect fit for this kind of experiemtn. Lets be clear, Cyber is:
- a project which works now. It is not the thing that needs years to be done. It is not the whitepaper. It is working stack for decentralised search foundation.
- a project from experienced team who has exceptional track record of creating blockchain application with utility. Original Golos - Russian speaking blockchain social network (which split into Cyberway and Golos classic now) [produce around ~140k transactions daily]((https://blocktivity.info/)) which is among top utilised blockchains in existence.
- ultimately transparent project with fair, and provable distribution.

As successful investors ourselves we are pretty sure that there are no project in Cosmos ecosystem exist with such risk/reward ratio. Anyway we need a good case for DeVC. The earlier we do it - the earlier we create a funnel of projects which will form the Internet of blockchains.

## Value appreciation

Sustainability of the community pool can be achieved through value appreciation of the tokens it holds. In case of Cyber the middle term **investment thesis** is that if Cyber reach 1% of Ethereum cap in 3 years Takeoff investments will bring around 50x-100x in ETH. Long term **investment thesis** is that if the project will be able to replace Google in 15 years so USD gain could be around 500000x-1000000x in current prices. Of course, such **potential gains could goes together only with significant associated risks** and can not be an easy way. But in case the original investment thesis will work such significant acquisition of value will benefit the community pool. So staking rewards from the share will continue to feed growing ecosystem among with AUM gains.

## Semantic targeting

Blockchain space become very competitive. Those, who will be able acquire target semantic core in search will have unfair advantage. SEO was primary factor of e-commerce success. Imagine if Cosmos could have lifetime subscription to Google Adwords? That is exactly what Cosmos hub get investing in CYB stake. It would be possible to delegate energy and power to some contract or professional under management in order to get on search excellence.

## Motivated hub-spoke model

The model for establishing economic relations between hub and spoke is not decided yet. One of such model proven viable in building horizontal and vertical monopolies is stake exchange. Two entity could be quite independent. But mutual skin in the game could bring better coordination due to shared in incentives. Investment in Cyber can become experimental playground.

## Conclusion

This gives us all the opportunity to see decentralization in action. Can an on-chain governance mechanism make such [complex decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence)? We think it can! After all, the idea of decentralised projects is to eventually become decentralised, without a single entity in charge of these projects.
