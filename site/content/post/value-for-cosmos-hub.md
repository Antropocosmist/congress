What will Cosmos Hub gain from participating in Cybers takeoff round as a hub?

Upon discussing proposal 26 that was submited by cyber to the Comsos hub, calling for it to make a collective decison about
participating in its takeoff round, we came upon some fantastic feedback and excellent questions form atom holders. I would 
iek to adreess them and to clarify things a bit.

The most common question is what will Comso hub gain from having CYB tokens in its community pool. This is probably the most 
improtant question and im glad it was asked by so many peopel. This shows that people care aobotu the ecsystem they are part 
of!

Cosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community.
It is for the very first time that we see a fully blown onchain governance mechanism at work with a communti pool that is actaulyl
fnding things and working for the best of its stkaeholders.

For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such 
foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.

A good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to 
network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value 
(its value rises).

The solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a 
diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.

This means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we 
want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing 
a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem.

This proposal challenges the very essence of decentralization. whta we propose in DeVC o decentrzlied VC. Rather then going to VC,
we want to utilize the instruments that decentrlation provides us. Cyber coming to Cosmos comm pool is the same as going to a VC.
Only here, we ask for a collective decison from the communtiy to becoem our anchor investor.

This gives us all all the posoiblity to see decentrleion in action. To see wether the internet of blockahins can be decentrlzied
and wether an onchain governance mechanism cna make such complex deciosns. After all, the idea of decentrlied projects is to eventually
become decentrlzied, without anyon ein chagre.
